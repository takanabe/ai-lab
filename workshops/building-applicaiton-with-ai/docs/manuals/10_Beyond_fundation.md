# Chapter 10 Beyond Foundations

Congratulations on completing the workshop.

Throughout this journey, you've built a full-featured application using AI-assisted development—from bootstrapping a Next.js project, to integrating authentication and external APIs, to polishing UI and layout. More importantly, you've learned how to collaborate with an AI agent like **Cline** using clear instructions, structured project context, and autonomous development loops.

This is not the end—it's your starting point.

Now it’s time to move **beyond the foundations**. The best way to grow is to **build something new, challenge the agent, and learn through iteration**. Below are some practical next steps and project ideas you can pursue to deepen your skills.

## What You Can Do Next

Here are some examples of where to take your learning:

### Add More Features to the Recipe App
- Add user ratings, categories, comments, or favorites
- Implement image uploads to Supabase Storage
- Add a meal planner or weekly calendar view

### Customize Your Workflow by Editing `.clinerules`
- Adjust architectural standards or naming conventions
- Define your own coding policies (e.g., use TanStack Query or Tailwind instead of Zustand and MUI)
- Change how tasks are broken down to reflect your team's workflow

### Refactor for Maintainability
- Move services into a dedicated `src/services/` directory
- Extract shared UI components (e.g., buttons, layout containers)
- Add types, validators, and error handling layers to solidify the app

### Rebuild the Same App with Different Rules
- Create a new `.clinerules` set with a different stack or structure
- Re-run the workshop with a different design or approach
- Compare how the AI behaves based on architectural or policy changes

### Learn More About Cline and Scale Up
- Dive deeper into how Cline works: [Cline Docs → Getting Started for New Coders](https://docs.cline.bot/getting-started/for-new-coders)
- Explore features like **Memory Bank**, which helps support large-scale, multi-module projects with persistent memory
- Try Cline in team settings by sharing `.clinerules` across repos and enforcing consistent structure at scale

### Deploying secure environment

- Use dev container (VSCode) to segregate your local environment and AI accessible environment for more secure development and use the environment for AI-driven development.


## Closing Thoughts

What you've learned here isn’t just about building an app—it's about building **systems collaboratively with AI**. You now understand how to:
- Define context and structure your project for AI success
- Use planning and execution loops effectively
- Debug, test, and refine code in collaboration with an agent
- Think in terms of reusable workflows, not just one-off scripts

The future of software development is **not just faster code**, but better **collaboration between humans and machines**. Your job isn’t to replace manual work with automation—it’s to shape that automation with intent, structure, and clarity.

So ask yourself:

> What will you build next?

And how will you use what you've learned—not just to generate code, but to design workflows, teach agents, and build better systems. The path forward is yours to define.

Good luck—and keep building,

Taka
