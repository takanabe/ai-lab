# Getting Started with Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Overview

Before we begin exploring AI-driven development, it's important to understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) operate in practice. This section introduces core ideas that will help you use LLMs more effectively as tools in your development workflow.

This page focuses on how LLMs work, not through theory or complex math, but through practical, testable behaviors you can try directly using LibreChat.


## What Is a Large Language Model?

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of program that predicts what comes next in a sentence. It has been trained on large volumes of text (websites, books, code, conversations) and learned to generate text that follows natural language patterns.

Think of an LLM as:

- A very advanced autocomplete system
- That can answer questions, generate summaries, write code, or simulate reasoning

LLMs don't "understand" things in a human way. They simulate understanding by using language patterns seen during training.

## Why This Matters for Developers

Modern LLMs can assist with:

- Code generation
- Debugging
- Testing
- Writing documentation
- Designing systems
- Running tasks via tools

To take advantage of this, you'll need to know how to communicate with LLMs effectively. That begins with learning the different prompting strategies and reasoning patterns.

## Key Concepts You'll Learn

This section introduces four foundational ideas through examples:

| Concept             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Zero-shot prompting | Ask a question or assign a task with no examples                           |
| One-shot prompting  | Give one example to guide the LLM’s behavior                               |
| Chain of thought    | Encourage step-by-step reasoning for better results                        |
| Tools               | Extend LLM capabilities with external actions like code generation, refactoring, or API calls |
| Agents              | Use reasoning to plan tasks, choose tools, and solve complex problems autonomously |


This section introduces five foundational ideas through hands-on examples. You'll test each concept directly in LibreChat by copying and pasting the provided prompts. Each prompt includes an example of what you should expect from the LLM in return.


### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

**Concept**  
Give the model a task with no examples. It relies on general knowledge from training.

**Use Case**  
You want the model to perform a task without prior instruction, like translation or summarization.

**Prompt to try in LibreChat**  
Copy and paste the following into the chat:

Translate this sentence into French: The book is on the table.

**Expected Response**

Le livre est sur la table.

---

### 2. One-Shot Prompting

**Concept**  
Give one clear example to help the model generalize the task.

**Use Case**  
You want the model to follow a specific pattern, such as extracting structured data.

**Prompt to try in LibreChat**  
Copy and paste the following into the chat:

Example:
Input: Jane Doe, janedoe@example.com
Output: Name: Jane Doe, Email: janedoe@example.com

Now do this:
Input: John Smith, john@example.org

**Expected Response**

Name: John Smith, Email: john@example.org


### 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

**Concept**  
Guide the model to reason step-by-step instead of jumping directly to the answer.

**Use Case**  
You want the model to solve a math problem, logic puzzle, or reasoning task.

**Prompt to try in LibreChat**  
Copy and paste the following into LibreChat:

Let's think step by step.
If a toy costs $15 and you have $50, how much money will you have left after buying two toys?

**Expected Response**

- Step 1: A toy costs $15.
- Step 2: Buying two toys means 15 * 2 = $30.
- Step 3: You have $50. Subtracting $30 leaves you with $20.
- Answer: $20

### 4. Tools (in AI-Driven Development)

**Concept**  
In AI development environments (like modern IDEs), a **tool** is a specific action the system can use to assist the user. Tools extend what a language model can do beyond just generating text.

**Examples of Tools in IDEs**
| Tool Type                | Examples in IDE                                      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Code generation          | GitHub Copilot autocomplete, Cursor inline actions  |
| Refactor suggestions     | Rename symbol, extract method, convert to async      |
| Static analysis          | ESLint, TypeScript type checks, Pyright             |
| Error explanation        | Cursor “Explain Error”, Copilot Chat                 |
| Test generation          | Generate unit tests                                  |
| Code navigation          | Jump to definition, find all references              |
| Command execution        | Shell tool in Cursor, terminal integration           |

**Use Case**  
You're editing code and want a tool to automatically refactor a function or generate unit tests.


### 5. AI Agents (Orchestrating Tools with Reasoning)

**Concept**  
An **AI agent** is a system that can:
1. Understand the task
2. Plan multiple steps
3. Choose the right tools
4. Execute actions
5. Return results or ask follow-up questions

In modern IDEs like **Cursor** or with **Copilot Chat**, agents simulate this behavior by coordinating tools with reasoning logic.

**Use Case**

You encounter an error and want the system to reason about it, suggest a fix, and apply changes.

## Conclusion

In this section, you've learned how Large Language Models (LLMs) behave through testable, hands-on examples. By experimenting with different prompting strategies—zero-shot, one-shot, and chain-of-thought—you’ve built a practical foundation for guiding LLMs effectively.

You also explored how LLMs extend beyond simple text generation by interacting with tools and functioning as reasoning-based agents in development environments like modern IDEs. These agents internally apply the same techniques you’ve practiced—zero-shot reasoning, example-guided prompting, and chain-of-thought logic—often in a loop. They plan, evaluate, and revise as they decide what tool to use next, simulating the way a developer would debug or refactor code interactively.

This loop of reasoning, tool use, observation, and iteration is what allows AI agents to act autonomously and handle increasingly complex tasks.

As you continue through this workshop, keep experimenting with prompts and watch for these patterns in action. Understanding how these techniques work together under the hood will prepare you to collaborate more effectively with AI systems—and ultimately build smarter, more adaptive workflows.
